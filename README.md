# Phase 3 Lecture 1: Object-Oriented Programming

## Objectives

By the end of today's lecture, you will be able to create a class with basic properties and methods. You will also be able to define instances of that class.

## Lesson Plan

0. Run `pipenv install` to install the dependencies and `pipenv shell` to enter the virtual environment.
1. Define a class Cat.
    - What is a **class**?
2. Define a constructor for the Cat class to assign it attributes name, color, and age.
    - What is a **constructor**? What is a **magic method**?
    - What is an **attribute**?
3. Define properties for these attributes.
    - What is a **property**?
    - What are the two ways to define a property?
4. Define methods for each object to meow and have a birthday.
    - What is an **instance method**?
5. Define method to print each object.
    - What is **overriding**?
6. Repeat by defining a class Pup for more practice.

## Looking Ahead

Tomorrow's lecture will continue our work with object-oriented programming by expanding to discussing class attributes and class methods.
